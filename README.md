# MSCS532_Assignment3
# Python Implementations

This repository contains implementations of a hash table and quicksort algorithm in Python.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Code

#### On Windows

1. Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python files are located.
3. Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    python HashTable.py
    python Quicksort.py
    ```

#### On Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python files are located.
3. Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    python3 HashTable.py
    python3 Quicksort.py
    ```

### Example Usage

#### HashTable.py

The `HashTable.py` file includes a test section that demonstrates how to use the hash table implementation. When you run the file, it will:

- Create a new hash table.
- Insert key-value pairs.
- Search for inserted keys.
- Update an existing key.
- Delete a key.
- Handle collisions.

You can modify the test section to add more test cases or change the existing ones.

#### Quicksort.py

The `Quicksort.py` file includes implementations of both randomized and deterministic quicksort algorithms. When you run the file, it will:

- Sort various test cases using randomized quicksort.
- Measure and print the time taken to sort arrays of different sizes and distributions using deterministic quicksort.

You can modify the test section to add more test cases or change the existing ones.
